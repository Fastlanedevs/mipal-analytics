# Contributing to Mipal Analytics

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Mipal Analytics as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards.
3. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Make sure your code lints** following our style guidelines.
6. **Update documentation** if needed.
7. **Issue that pull request**!

## Coding Standards

### Backend (Python)

- **Type Hints**: Always use Python type definitions as specified in project rules
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for functions and classes
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new functionality
- **Dependencies**: Use `uv` for dependency management

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_data(items: List[str], filter_empty: bool = True) -> Optional[List[str]]:
    """Process a list of items with optional filtering.
    
    Args:
        items: List of string items to process
        filter_empty: Whether to filter out empty strings
        
    Returns:
        Processed list of items, or None if input is invalid
    """
    if not items:
        return None
    
    if filter_empty:
        return [item for item in items if item.strip()]
    return items
```

### Frontend

- **Code Style**: Follow established JavaScript/TypeScript conventions
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Testing**: Write component tests for new UI features
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible (WCAG guidelines)

## Development Setup

### Backend Development

1. **Navigate to backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```

### Frontend Development

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Frontend Testing

- Write component tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test user interactions and component behavior
- Mock API calls in tests
